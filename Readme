## Usage

To use this project, you can clone the repository and start adding your own SASS styles within the respective folders. Make sure to prefix each SASS file with an underscore (_) to indicate that it is a partial. For example, `_reset.scss` or `_buttons.scss`.

Remember to import all the partials in the main.scss file to generate the final CSS output.

Feel free to customize the folder structure to fit your project's needs. Happy coding!

## main.scss

The main.scss file serves as the entry point for compiling the SASS stylesheets of the project. It acts as a central file that imports all the partials from the different folders within the 7-1 SASS folder structure.

In this file, you will find a series of import statements that import the partials in a specific order to ensure proper cascading of styles and dependencies. By organizing the imports in a logical order, it helps in maintaining a structured and manageable codebase.

It is important to note that the main.scss file itself does not contain any actual styles or CSS rules. Its sole purpose is to import the partials and combine them into a single SASS file, which will then be compiled into the final CSS output.

Make sure to add any global styles or additional imports that are necessary for the project in this file. It is also common practice to include any necessary vendor prefixes or global variables that need to be accessible throughout the project.

Remember to compile the main.scss file to generate the final CSS file that can be linked to your HTML files.

Happy styling!
